TODO
----
* Fix the tests so they can be run with junit 4.8 not just 4.7 then make them
  run during the build.
* Work out the bnd issue where it thinks there is a header called "Name".
  Apparently fixed in later versions but the debian package for bnd is very out
  of date.
* Use JavaCC to regenerating Java files included in upstream tarball
* Use JFlex to generate Java files included in upstream tarball (needs 1.5 - not
  yet released)
